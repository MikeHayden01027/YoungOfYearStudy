    "text": "1 Introduction\nClimate change is one of the most significant global issues affecting people and ecosystems. The increased frequency of extreme climatic events, including droughts, floods, and storms, may affect whole ecosystems and specific species populations (Thibault & Brown, 2008). Therefore, it is crucial to predict the response of aquatic species to climate change to determine their future viability in a rapidly changing world (Kareiva et al., 1993; Shuter & Post, 1990).\nBrook Trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) is a freshwater fish native to eastern North American lakes, rivers, and streams from northern Quebec to Georgia (Meisner, 1990). Brook Trout faces potentially drastic range decreases because of accelerating climate change, as their requirement for cold, pristine waters leaves them especially sensitive to rising water temperatures (Clark et al., 2001). Droughts can force juvenile brook trout into unfavorable habitats and scour redds. With climate change threatening brook trout persistence in their native range, more research on the impacts of stream discharge and temperature on brook trout presence is needed to protect and restore brook trout populations (Armstrong & Nislow, 2012; Riley et al., 2009).\nThe juvenile life stage, more commonly known as the young-of-the-year (YOY), begins when Brook Trout fry emerges from the redds in the spring. This process continues until December 31st, after which YOY are considered age-1 or adult brook trout. According to several studies, the YOY life stage is the most crucial in determining the viability of the entire population. While a significant factor in establishing year-class abundance, little is known about how stream discharge and temperature influence YOY survival as well as the timing of early life events such as spawn, hatching, and emergence (Blum et al., 2018; Kanno et al., 2016). Thus, a more comprehensive understanding of how stream discharge and temperature influence the timing of these life history events is needed to manage Brook Trout streams better.\nIn 2014, a preliminary pilot study was initiated to investigate the factors influencing YOY brook trout survival. Ecologists observed a considerable variation (ranging from 40mm to 90mm) in the body size of YOY brook trout during the spring and fall samples in West Brook. Numerous factors influence body size, including food availability, population density, and ambient temperature. The researchers decided to investigate the potential influence of hatch date and growth rate on the body size of individual YOY. The pilot study aimed to examine other factors that impact body size, such as high-resolution stream discharge and temperature data. The availability of new data has allowed ecologists to broaden their inquiry and examine the impact of stream discharge and temperature on the survival of YOY brook trout.",

    "text": "3 Abstract\nBrook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis)is a cold-water species native to streams of Eastern North America whose populations often exhibit significant year-to-year variation in body size. Previous research has found that this variation is related to environmental variables like stream flow and water temperature, but less is known about the biological mechanisms driving these patterns. In particular, temperature-mediated timing of early life events (spawning, hatching, and emergence) may underlie spatial, temporal, and among-individual variation in Young-of-Year (YOY) body size. Early emerging individuals have more time to grow than late-emerging individuals and may, therefore, gain a size-based competitive advantage, but this could come at the cost of greater exposure to early-season environmental stressors such as higher flows, colder temperatures, and lack of food (in addition to increased predation risk). To understand how emergence phenology mediates the effect of temperature on Brook Trout population dynamics, finer-scale research is needed on emergence patterns across years, streams, and individuals. To address this, from 2014 to 2023, we carried out a field study in six headwater streams across Western Massachusetts, exploring the relationship between YOY brook trout emergence and environmental variables (stream flow and temperature). We combined direct (periodic dip-net surveys to monitor for the presence of YOY) and indirect (back-calculating emergence date based on ages estimated from otoliths) techniques to estimate the emergence timing of YOY brook trout. Preliminary results indicate wide variation in emergence timing within the streams, among streams, and between years. We tested the degree to which year-to-year differences could be predicted by both water temperatures and spawn timing. Data on emergence timing will help assess its effect on the body size distribution of YOY and early life survival, especially considering the threats posed by an increase in high-flow events during their most vulnerable periods.",

    "text": "6.1 Study Site Locations\nThe study was conducted at six first- and second-order streams within the Connecticut River Watershed in Western Massachusetts, USA, between 2014 and 2015. Because we were researching if there was an effect of temperatur on the emergence timing of YOY brook trout, streams across a wide temperature spectrum were chosen. Eight potential study sites were compiled from a study on adult brook trout’s upper thermal tolerance limit. The dip-net technique assessed each site for the presence of young-of-the-year (YOY) brook trout. The two sites with minimal or no YOY brook trout were excluded. Six were selected from the eight streams studied.\nFrom north to south, Four Mile Brook, located in Northfield, Massachusetts, is a low-gradient second-order headwater stream with a substrate composed of boulders and cobble. Pond Brook, whose substrate consists of sand and gravel, is a low-gradient headwater stream in Montague, Massachusetts. The next three streams are located within the West Brook Watershed, a small third-order stream in Whately, Massachusetts. West Whately Brook is a low-gradient headwater stream with a substrate made of sand and gravel. Sanderson Brook is a high-gradient second-order headwater stream with a substrate of cobbles and boulders. O’bear Upper Brook is a high-gradient first-order headwater stream with an average width smaller than that of Sanderson Brook but with a similar substrate. In Montgomery, Massachusetts, is a stream named Roaring Brook, whose substrate is dominated by large boulders and bedrock.\nAfter selecting the study streams, we standardized the ideal dip netting habitats across all sites. Capturing young-of-the-year (YOY) fish is more effective in calm, shallow waters near the stream banks, previously identified as YOY habitats (Hayden personal observation). These tranquil areas also provide clear visibility for observers. Attempting to make each study stream the same length proved ineffective, as more significant streams also contain YOY habitats in the middle and along the banks. Therefore, we used the total wetted area to ensure that each study site was comparable. Yellow-capped rebar stakes were used to mark the upstream and downstream boundaries of all study locations sites. Stream temperature was recorded every 15 minutes using Hobo Pro v2 temperature loggers (Model U22-001; Onset Computer Inc., Bourne, MA, USA), which were cable-tied to trees in PVC housing.\n\nMapTable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.1: Interactive table of all the six YOY study streams\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.2: Interactive table of all the six YOY study streams",

    "text": "6.2 Emergence Estimation\n\n6.2.1 Direct (Dip Net / Electrofisher )\nThe sampling season was split into two parts to effectively collect data on the body size distribution during the first six months of the brook trout YOY life cycle. It comprised dipnet sampling in the spring and two electrofishing samples in the summer and fall. Initially, from March to July, the trout experienced rapid growth; this was followed by a notable slowdown from June to October. In late January, the researcher visited each stream weekly and checked the slack water of each study stream to check for the presence of newly emerged YOY. When emergence began, the researcher continued to visit the stream, using dip nets, and attempted to catch every YOY trout in the study section. YOY was measured for fork length and released into the stream. When the YOY could not be effectively captured using dip-nets, each study stream was electrofished once in the summer and once in the fall. Each study site was divided into three sections: 40 m, one at the downstream end, one in the middle, and one at the upstream end. Brook trout adults and juveniles were captured using a backpack electrofisher, measured for fork length, and returned to the section they were caught in.\nAll data were entered into an Excel file and loaded into R (Team 2008). An upper, middle, and lower quantile regression was utilized to calculate the beginning, middle, and end of emergence. When the juvenile Brook Trout data were graphed by fork length and detection date, it was noted that the size distribution increased at the same rate for the first two to four samples, then leveled off for the remaining samples (Figure 6.2). It was hypothesized that the distribution leveled off not because of a decrease in growth, but due to a reduction in capture probability as fry size coincided with an increase in speed. The researcher could see larger YOY but was unable to capture them. It was assumed that the slope of this line could be used to calculate the date when the size distribution correlated with the start of emergence. The beginning of emergence was hypothesized to occur when the maximum and minimum size distributions were the same, which may be 19mm for two reasons. First, the smallest size of YOY was observed during the dip net samples. Second, the size of a newly hatched Brook Trout for the 2014 thermal tolerance study was between 12-18mm (Letcher, B.H., Odonnell, M.J., Unpublished Data).\nThe end of emergence was determined using the same theory. Throughout the emergence period, the size distribution maintained a consistent minimum of 19 mm ± 1. A change in this pattern corresponded with the end of emergence. A lower quantile (0.02) regression was employed to calculate the date when emergence concluded. The middle or peak of emergence utilized the same method as the start and end, with linear regression applied instead of quantile regression.\nThe data were first filtered to include all juvenile Brook Trout captured from the dip net and the initial electrofishing samples. Next, the data were organized by river and year to calculate the start of emergence and an upper quantile regression was conducted for each nested data frame. The data were un-nested, and the slope and intercept from each quantile regression were utilized to determine the day of the year when the line intersected a fork length of 19 mm, representing the emergence size. The emergence calculation method was reiterated for the middle quantile. To enhance end-of-emergence calculations, the data for the lower quantile models were filtered to exclude the initial few samples. If the first few samples were retained, the quantile’s estimate for the emergence end would have occurred earlier.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.3: Relationship of body size over time for Pond Brook during the 2015 spring dip-net and electrofishing sample. An example of how the body size distributions over days of the year can be used to calculate emergence timing. The three lines represent the upper (red) , middle (orange) , and lower (green) quantile regression.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.2.2 Indirect (Otolith)\nFish were collected for otoliths, once during the dip-net sample and once during each electrofishing sample. For the dip net sample collection, seven weeks after emergence began at an individual site, six fish were collected, representing the body size distribution measured in fork length. During the summer and fall electrofishing samples, nine fish were taken at each study site, representing the full body size distribution. Fish collected for otolith analysis were placed in individual bags, each labeled with the fish’s fork length, stream, and date killed. The bags were then placed in a freezer.",

    "text": "4 Introduction\nOtoliths are tiny, calcified structures found in a fish’s head that aid orientation and hearing (Campana and Neilson 1985). In addition to their biological role, Otoliths serve as valuable resources for fisheries biologists and managers, enabling them to reconstruct the life history of individual fish. When viewed under a microscope, the otolith looks like a tree stump with individual rings corresponding to the years the fish has been alive. Upon closer inspection, one notices that the large yearly rings are composed of smaller daily rings. Both yearly and daily rings allow managers and scientists to gather information on birth date (Campana and Neilson 1985), environmental water chemistry (Høie, Otterlei, and Folkvord 2004; Radtke et al. 1996), metabolic rate, and even size at age estimates [ Ashworth (2017) ; Campana (1990) ; Vigliola and Meekan (2009)]. Size at age estimates is valuable information because they have many applications. For example, knowing cod’s otolith age/size relationship can prohibit fishermen from harvesting the most fecund age/size class in this species. (Høie, Otterlei, and Folkvord 2004; Anderson, Claiborne, and Smith 2023)\nAlthough back-calculation is widely used to estimate past sizes at a given age, three assumptions must be met. First, an annual or daily rate of ring deposition that does not vary; second, increments can be read precisely and accurately; and third, a relationship between increment spacing and somatic growth is usually measured in body size (Campana 1990; Vigliola and Meekan 2009). The first two assumptions are met through ring formation rate and reader evaluations; however, the third requires further analysis because of the possibility of somatic growth uncoupling from otolith ring deposition, leading to either underestimation or overestimating body size (Campana 1990; Vigliola and Meekan 2009). This can happen either because of a “growth effect,” where the otolith of slow-growing fish is larger at a given size than that of fast-growing fish, or an “age effect,” where the deposition of daily rings occurs despite fluctuations in somatic growth (Vigliola and Meekan 2009). Therefore, a way to overcome this needs to be established [(Covich, Crowl, and Heartsill-Scalley 2006)\nSeveral methodologies have been used to account for the age and growth effect of the relationship between otolith and fish size. The Frasher Lee methodology attempted to account for the age/growth effect by assuming that if the otolith was 10% larger than the mean size, the fish must be 10% larger than the others [Vigliola and Meekan (2009)][.] Campana (1990) introduced a modification known as the biological intercept method, which posited that the fish had a specific size when the otolith measured zero, which was integrated with the proportionality concept of the Frasher-Lee equation. Additionally, other methods have utilized temperature to clarify the relationship (Mosegaard, Svedäng, and Taberman 1988; Shafer 2000). Using developmental temperature as a proxy; I propose to build upon past work and test the relationship between juvenile brook trout otolith and fish size.",

The largest YOY grew the fastest and the smallest YOY grew the slowest.\nDifferent Emergence Date - Same Growth Rate (DE/SG), assumes the growth rate remains the same but the emergence time varies among individuals. The earliest emerges become the largest YOY and the later emerges become the smallest YOY.\nDifferent Emergence Date and Growth Rate (Mix), assumes that both growth rate and emergence date vary among individuals with each one contributing the the size variation observed in the fall. Hypothetically a YOY can emerge later, but into a more favorable environment thus grow faster and become one of the larger YOY in the fall.",
